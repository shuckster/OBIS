{"name":"OBIS: Online Banking Is Shit","tagline":"A JavaScript framework for downloading bank statements in OFX, QIF, CSV, and JSON. Currently supports HSBC UK Personal Banking.","body":"## About\r\n\r\nRight now, OBIS is for downloading statements from HSBC UK Personal Banking\r\nin a variety of different formats. HSBC only allows downloading of the last\r\n3 months of transaction data. That's shit. OBIS can download the lot.\r\n\r\nCurrently supports _only_ HSBC UK, but other parsers are possible. Works best\r\nin Google Chrome. Other browsers will work, but won't benefit from automatic\r\nnaming of your Zip download.\r\n\r\nSaves a Zip of your statements in OFX, QIF, CSV, JSON, or all of them.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of HSBC UK parser](https://github.com/shuckster/OBIS/raw/master/screenshot.gif)\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nOpen [dist/bookmarklet.js](https://github.com/shuckster/OBIS/raw/master/dist/bookmarklet.js), copy everything, paste into a new bookmark, log in\r\nto your HSBC UK _Previous Statements_ page, click the new bookmark.\r\n\r\nThat bookmark will load OBIS directly from the Github raw master, so if\r\nsomething breaks you shouldn't need to do anything when it gets fixed. (Except\r\nmaybe clear your browser-cache).\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\n\r\nOpen [API.md](https://github.com/shuckster/OBIS/raw/master/API.md) for instructions on how to use OBIS with your own\r\nparsers.\r\n\r\n## License & credits\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 by [Conan Theobald](mailto:me[at]conans[dot]co[dot]uk)\r\n\r\nMIT licensed: See [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/shuckster/OBIS/raw/master/LICENSE.md)\r\n\r\nInspired by:\r\n\r\n*   https://github.com/LTheobald/HSBCToOFX\r\n*   http://aralbalkan.com/3744\r\n\r\nImplements the fine work of these 3rd parties:\r\n\r\n*   http://stuartk.com/jszip\r\n*   http://eligrey.com/blog/post/saving-generated-files-on-the-client-side\r\n*   http://www.webtoolkit.info/\r\n*   http://jquery.com/\r\n\r\njQuery 1.5.2 is used because that's the version HSBC UK use.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
